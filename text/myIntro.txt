👋 Hey there! I’m Pulasari Jai, can call me Invictus Jai, a tech enthusiast, aspiring software developer, and a passionate dancer and artist. Fresh out of +2 science, I’m on a mission to blend code with choreography and pixels with paintbrush strokes.

🚀 My journey began with a curiosity for technology, and it has led me to explore from 'Hello World' to advance projects and much more. When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me twirling on the dance floor or creating digital masterpieces.

🌟 On my GitHub, you’ll discover projects that showcase both my analytical mind and my artistic soul. Whether it’s a sleek web app, an elegant dance routine, or a captivating design, I pour my heart into every endeavor.

🎥 Catch me sharing tech insights, dance moves, and art inspiration on my YouTube channel. Let’s connect there and celebrate the beautiful fusion of creativity and code!

Let’s build the future together—one rhythm, one brushstroke, and one line of code at a time! 🌐💃🎨💻
